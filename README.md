# Objectives of the adif2json Project

The `adif2json` project aims to provide a simple and effective way to convert Amateur Data Interchange Format (ADIF) files to JSON format and vice versa. The key objectives of the project include:

- **ADIF to JSON Conversion:** The primary goal of this project is to convert ADIF files into a JSON format. This feature allows users to transform ADIF files into a more versatile and widely-used format.

- **JSON to ADIF Recovery:** In addition to converting ADIF files to JSON, `adif2json` also aims to provide the ability to recover the original ADIF file from the generated JSON file.

- **Format Correctness Verification:** The project ensures that the conversion process between ADIF and JSON respects the correct format of both file types.

## Limitations of the adif2json Project

While the `adif2json` project is designed to handle conversions between ADIF and JSON formats, it is important to note its limitations:

- **No Data Validation:** `adif2json` does not validate the data contained within the files. Its primary function is to convert the file formats, not to verify the correctness of the data.

- **No Conversion to Other Amateur Radio File Formats:** The project is specifically designed to handle ADIF and JSON files. It does not support conversion to or from other file formats used in amateur radio.

- **No ADIF File Repair or Modification:** `adif2json` does not provide the functionality to repair or modify ADIF files. It is solely a conversion tool.

By understanding these objectives and limitations, users can effectively utilize `adif2json` for their ADIF and JSON file conversion needs.
